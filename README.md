# AI Query Generator

 This project is a full-stack application that automates database query generation and execution using vector embeddings and AI language models.

## Features
1. Vector Embeddings: Created embeddings of database schema tables using Langchain, stored in Pinecone.
2. Similarity Search: Finds the top 5 relevant tables by matching user queries with vector embeddings.
3. AI-Powered Query Generation: Uses OpenAI's language model to generate SQL/NoSQL queries from user prompts and relevant tables.
